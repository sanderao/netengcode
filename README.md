Self Healing Virtual Network Function

Problem Statement 

You know how a complex network can be expensive to manage and require a large IT staff count. In addition, the time it takes to identify root causes and take corrective measures can result in more lost revenue for businesses.

What can we do  

Interestingly, a large amount of research and testing on self-healing in power grids is happening in the United States with some remarkable results.Self-healing netowrks could serve to cut down, or almost entirely eliminate the problem resolution.

How do we do it  

Well in today's hack we would like to demonstarte an introduction to self healing virtual network function. If, for instance, a virtual network functio is experiencing high CPU usage that results in lost data packets, the system would be notified and quickly spin up a new virtual network function. All this would occur in a matter of minutes.
